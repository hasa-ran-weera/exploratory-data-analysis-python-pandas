# Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas  

This repository contains my hands-on project completed as part of the **Coursera Project Network**: *Exploratory Data Analysis With Python and Pandas*.  

## 📘 Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to practice **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques using Python.  
I worked with tabular datasets to clean, manipulate, and visualize data, uncovering meaningful patterns and insights.  

## 🎯 What I Learned  
- Apply practical EDA techniques on tabular datasets using **Pandas** and **NumPy**  
- Perform **data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation**  
- Conduct **correlation analysis** to explore relationships between variables  
- Produce effective visualizations using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**  
- Extract insights to support **data-driven decision making**  

## 🛠️ Skills Gained
